- Complete rewrite from the ground up!
- Changed vanilla tree growers to use data-driven "sapling" configurations under the `endemic:sapling` resource key that can conditionally select tree features from a weighted tree grower if data is found for the block.
- Added a comprehensive set of configured features for all vanilla trees.
