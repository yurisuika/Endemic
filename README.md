Endemic is a Fabric mod that allows you to grow trees endemic to their biomes with vanilla saplings! Now you can regrow those swamp oaks, tall birches, pine spruces, and more!

### Source Building

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch Fabric-1.18 --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/endemic.git

cd ./endemic

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.

### Released Builds
