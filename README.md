*Harness the ability to grow any tree from a sapling!*

### Make the world feel more alive!
Endemic offers you the ability to configure how saplings grow! Do you wish that you could grow all of those endemic trees that you find in the world but once cut down are lost forever? Now you can regrow those swamp oaks, super birches, pine spruces, and more!

### Bring back the diversity of nature!
Make saplings grow up conditionally based on the surrounding dimension, biome, elevation, brightness, temperature, and downfall. This means you can create deep configurations in conjunction with mods that change the weather and seasons, make certain tree variants grow at certain altitudes, or make it so you can only grow certain trees in those special places where you find them natively to keep the charm and promote trade and travel!

By default, Endemic focuses on bringing those endemic tree variants such as swamp oaks back to their biomes, preserves trees growing in their native habitats, and makes saplings grown outside their native biomes and in low light end up growing as stunted and shrub forms.

### Any and all trees are welcome!
Endemic allows you to override any sapling that uses the vanilla tree grower, including modded saplings! Any sapling that does not have a configuration set will just follow its vanilla growth behavior.

With Endemic, you have the option to make saplings grow as intricately as you so choose. See the possibilities unfurl for yourself!

### Get the goods!
You can find releases of Endemic on both *[Modrinth]* and *[CurseForge]* and also access development builds on *[GitHub]*!
